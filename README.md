## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a small expressJS Server project I did to practice and demonstrate the creation and skill of building and starting an express server.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started you will need to first install the dependancies by using `npm install`. Then you can use `npm start` to run the server.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have nodemon and expressJS installed to run this server. 

```
npm i express
```
```
npm i nodemon
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
npm install
```

And then

```
npm start
```
